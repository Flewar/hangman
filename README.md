# Hangman by Moaz

A very simple hangman game made using Pygame package.I made it to practice using Classes in Python
it gets a random word from a list  and shows number of word in the word as underscores then it gets  guess from the player if the letter guessed  is in the word to be guessed it renders the letter in place of underscore according to its position in the word to be guessed
