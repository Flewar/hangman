# Hangman by Moaz

A very simple hangman game made using Pygame package.I made it to practice using Classes and Pygame in Python.                                 
 This game gets a random word from a list  and shows number of word in the word as underscores then it gets  guess from the player if the letter guessed  is in the word to be guessed it renders the letter in place of underscore according to its position in the word to be guessed if the players wins it prints wining message and, if the guess is incorrect it renders a part of the body of the hangman if all parts are rendered the player  loses  .
