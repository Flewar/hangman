# Hangman by Moaz

A very simple hangman game made using Pygame package.I made it to practice using Classes and Pygame in Python.                                 
 This game gets a random word from a list  and shows number of letters in the word as underscores. then it gets guess from the player, if the letter guessed  is in the word to be guessed, it renders the letter in place of underscore according to its position in the word to be guessed. if the players guesses all letters in the word and wins it renders the wining message and, if the guess is incorrect it renders a part of the body of the hangman if all parts are rendered the player  loses  .
